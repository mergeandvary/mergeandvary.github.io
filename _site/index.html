            Zeldin (1994: 75-6) eloquently writes that people ‘have been able to introduce new meaning into [love] again and again, as surprisingly as they have transformed grain into bread and dumplings and millefeuille cakes’. Lindholm (1998) suggests that the normative form love takes often differs depending on the way the social environment is organised. For many theorists (see Bauman 1999, 2001; Beck & Beck-Gernsheim 2002), modern risk society places an emphasis on private individuals shifting for themselves by carefully selecting from the choices provided by a free and open market premised on neoliberal principles of deregulation, liberalisation, and privatisation. Superficially, the concept of individualisation seems incompatible with the dyadic notions of intimacy.

            Internet anonymity provides democratic potential through allowing a greater sense of openness, equality, and freedom to express controversial view points. This allows for an ‘unprecedented’ wider public sphere participation from individuals who otherwise have ‘had little opportunity to participate in public debate’ (Rowland 2006: 519). Anonymity means that views can only be considered in terms of rational content: neither property nor privilege can be used to influence weight (Rowland 2006: 532). However, anonymity also allows for disassociation from individual identity and the creation or appropriation of other identities. It is frequently assumed that anonymity breeds incivility, damaging the Internet’s real potential for effective public sphere discourse. In the recent flurry of moral panic over Internet anonymity, trolling has become the mass media’s catch-all term for any unpleasant, hostile, or offensive comments made anonymously on the Internet. However, these attacks on trolling are perhaps misguided. This paper will delineate and examine some potential implications trolling has for effective public sphere discourse online.

            In     The Magic Cauldron, Raymond uses rational choice theory to demonstrate why a business might find greater value in preferring open – rather than closed – source software implementations. These arguments for free open source software (FOSS) are built from Raymond's previous discussion in The Cathedral and the Bazaar regarding how FOSS ideologies create an effective environment for software development. Many of the points raised by Raymond directly relate to why a researcher might prefer FOSS to solve domain problems in digital humanities projects.
