I started this blog as a project for a postgraduate digital humanities course. Pinning down exactly how to define digital humanities is an elusive task. Kathleen Fitzpatrick provides this straightforward definition:

> For me it has to do with the work that gets done at the crossroads of digital media and traditional humanistic study. And that happens in two different ways. On the one hand, it’s bringing the tools and techniques of digital media to bear on traditional humanistic questions. But it’s also bringing humanistic modes of inquiry to bear on digital media.
