As part of my digital humanities project, I am considering collecting and analysing tweets on the #INeedMasculismBecause hashtag. I am hoping to get some proof of concept so that I can employ this method or something similar in my research for my MRES next year. As this is a pretty new idea for me, I'm going to be documenting my journey here as a sort of resource journal. 

At first I had been struggling to find some information on how I would go about collecting data. I found some information about topsy.com, a service run by Apple that collected tweets and allowed end users to search that data in a variety of ways. Unfortunately, the service has now been shutdown.
